# 📝 Project Overview

This project focuses on building a spam detection system that classifies email messages as either spam or ham (non-spam). It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques to train a model that can predict whether an email is legitimate or malicious.

# 🧰 Libraries Used

Commonly used libraries in this notebook:
pandas – Data handling
numpy – Numerical operations
matplotlib & seaborn – Data visualization
sklearn – Machine learning and NLP tasks (CountVectorizer, train_test_split, models, metrics)
nltk – Natural Language Toolkit for text preprocessing


# 🎯 Objective


Understand patterns in email texts.
Accurately classify them as spam or ham.
Be used in real-world applications like email clients for filtering spam.

# 📁 Dataset Description

The dataset used contains two primary columns:
Category: The label indicating whether the email is ‘spam’ or ‘ham’.
Message: The actual email content.

# 🚀 Applications

Can be deployed in real-world email systems.
Helps users avoid phishing, scams, and promotional spam.


# 🎯 Conclusion:

The model can be deployed in mail systems to filter out spam.
With further tuning or use of deep learning models, performance can improve.
Can be extended to SMS, social media messages, and other text communication platforms.
